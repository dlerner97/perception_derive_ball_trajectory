Problem 2
Change directory to "C:/...your path.../dalerner_hw1/Code"
Then type "python dalerner_hw1.py" -> This should run entire script, one video at a time.

When the 1st video finishes and plots pop up, exit out of the window to continue to the next video.
If you want to only run one video, go into python dalerner_hw1.py and comment out one of the get_plot() calls.

Problem 3 
Keep directory at "C:/...your path.../dalerner_hw1/Code"
Then type "python dalerner_hw1_q3.py" -> This should run entire script
